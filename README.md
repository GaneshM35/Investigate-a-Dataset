### by Ganesh M

Investigate a Dataset project, part of the Udacity [Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009).

## Investigate a Dataset

Welcome to the linear regression project, This project is an investigation of the Titanic passenger dataset using NumPy and Pandas. It illustrates the entire data analysis process, from posing the relevant questions to finishing by sharing my findings on the same.

## To install

You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Project Contains

This project consists for the following files:

* titanic-data.csv - copy of the dataset
* Titanic Dataset Investigation.html - HTML version of the report
* Titanic Dataset Investigation.ipynb - iPython notebook - used to generate the report
